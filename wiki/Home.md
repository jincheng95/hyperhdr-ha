## Installation

### Using HACS

1. Add [https://github.com/Shaffer-Softworks/hyperhdr-ha](https://github.com/Shaffer-Softworks/hyperhdr-ha) to your [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) custom repositories.
2. Choose **Integration** from the category selection.
3. Click install.
4. Return to the Integrations page within HACS then click the **+ Explore & download repositories** button.
5. Search for **HyperHDR**, select it, then click **Download this repository with HACS**.
6. Restart Home Assistant to load the integration.
7. Visit the Wiki for: [Initial Setup](#initial-setup), [Post-setup Advice](#post-setup-advice), [Debug Logging](#debug-logging).

### Manual Installation (not recommended)

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Shaffer-Softworks/hyperhdr-ha/releases) as a zip file, extract it, and move the `hyperhdr` folder into the `custom_components` folder in your Home Assistant installation.
- Restart Home Assistant to load the integration.

**Dependencies:** This integration requires `hyperhdr-py-sickkick==0.2.3`. When installing via HACS, the package is installed automatically. For manual installation, ensure your Home Assistant environment has this package available.

## Initial Setup

### Automatic Discovery (SSDP)

HyperHDR instances on your local network are automatically discovered via SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol). When a new instance is found, a notification appears in Home Assistant's Integrations page — just click Configure and confirm to set it up. The host, JSON API port, and WebSocket port are all populated automatically from the discovery data.

### Manual Setup

1. In Home Assistant go to **Configuration** → **Devices & Services** → **Integrations**.
2. Click the **+ Add Integration** button.
3. Search for **HyperHDR**.
4. If you cannot find **HyperHDR** in the list, clear your browser cache and/or perform a hard-refresh of the page.
5. Enter the host (and optional WebSocket port and admin password), then click **Submit**.

### Authentication

If your HyperHDR instance has Local API Authentication enabled, the integration will guide you through a token-based authentication flow:

- **Option 1:** Provide an existing authentication token.
- **Option 2:** Create a new token automatically — the integration generates a random auth ID, opens the HyperHDR UI for approval, and validates the token once approved.
- Click the **Submit** button.

Additionally, the LED camera streams require the admin password for authentication (token-only auth is insufficient for the `imagestream-start` command). You can provide the admin password during initial setup or add/change it later via the integration's **Options**.

---

## Options Flow

After the integration is set up, you can adjust settings via the **Options** gear icon on the integration card.

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Priority | Default priority level for light commands (0–255). | `128` |
| Clear priority when main light turns off | Sends HyperHDR's `clear` command at the configured priority when the main light is turned off, so sources like USB grabber can take over again. | `false` |
| Keep WLED in realtime mode when off (idle black) | When enabled, turning off the main light keeps the LED device enabled and sends a black output instead of disabling the LED device. This prevents WLED from resuming stored presets when the light is "off". Useful for WLED backends where disabling the LED device releases WLED from realtime mode. | `false` |
| Effect Show List | Select which HyperHDR effects to expose in Home Assistant. New effects added to HyperHDR will appear by default. | All effects shown |
| WebSocket Port | Port for LED camera streams. | `8090` |
| Admin Password | Password for LED stream authentication and for HyperHDR v22 smoothing config get/set when local admin auth is enabled. | (empty) |

---

## Platforms & Entities

This integration creates the following platforms:

| Platform | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `button` | Clear the configured HyperHDR priority slot. |
| `camera` | Live LED Colors and LED Gradient camera streams via WebSocket. |
| `light` | Control HyperHDR lighting with color, brightness, and effects. |
| `sensor` | Monitor visible priority and average color information. |
| `switch` | Toggle HyperHDR components, plus Anti-flicker Filter and Continuous Output when smoothing config is available. |
| `number` | Smoothing parameters (time, update frequency, factor, stiffness, damping, Y limit) when config get/set is available. |
| `select` | Choose v22 smoothing interpolator type when config get/set is available. |

### Light

Two light entities are created for each HyperHDR instance:

- **HyperHDR Priority Light** (disabled by default) — Controls only the configured priority level (default 128). Does not support external effects. Useful for advanced priority-based control.
- **HyperHDR Light** (enabled by default) — Controls the LED device on/off state and displays the currently visible priority. Supports color, brightness, and effect selection (including external source effects like Video Grabber and USB Capture). Optionally enable **Clear priority when main light turns off** in integration options so turning this light off also clears the configured priority slot (useful when USB grabber or other sources stay blocked after solid color or effect control).

Both entities expose HyperHDR effects in the effect list. The "Solid" effect is always available for setting solid colors.

### Button

- **Clear Priority** (enabled by default) — Manually clears the configured priority slot via HyperHDR's JSON API `clear` command (same as the web UI). Use this after solid color or effect control if USB grabber or another source does not resume—for example when the main light stays on but you re-enable capture via a component switch.

### Switch

Nine component switches are created (all disabled by default), intended for advanced users:

| Switch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| All | Master toggle for all components |
| Smoothing | Toggle LED smoothing |
| Blackbar Detection | Toggle blackbar detection |
| Forwarder | Toggle priority forwarder |
| Boblight Server | Toggle Boblight server |
| Platform Capture | Toggle platform screen capture |
| LED Device | Toggle the LED device output |
| USB Capture | Toggle USB video capture |
| HDR Tone Mapping | Toggle HDR tone mapping processing |

When HyperHDR smoothing **config** can be read (see Admin Password note below), two additional config switches are created (disabled by default):

| Switch | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Anti-flicker Filter | `antiFlickeringFilter` in HyperHDR v22 smoothing config |
| Continuous Output | `continuousOutput` in HyperHDR v22 smoothing config |

### Camera

Two camera entities are created (both disabled by default):

#### LED Colors Camera

Streams the HyperHDR imagestream output over a dedicated WebSocket connection.

- **Authentication:** Requires admin password when Local API Authentication is enabled.
- **Stream Type:** Uses `HyperHDRLedColorsStream` with automatic reconnection.
- **Purpose:** Designed for PicCap instances where the standard MJPEG stream may not work, or for visualizing the exact LED output.

#### LED Gradient Camera

Visualizes the raw per-LED color data as a gradient image.

- **Average Color:** This camera computes the average RGB color from each frame and dispatches it to the Average Color sensor (throttled to every 2 seconds).
- **Image Format:** Raw binary LED data (RGB bytes) is converted into a 1-pixel-tall JPEG image scaled to 20px height for visibility.
- **Purpose:** Displays a JPEG image representing the current color of each LED, stretched to a visible height. Useful for monitoring individual LED output in real time.

### Sensor

Two sensor entities are created:

#### Visible Priority Sensor

Shows the currently active (visible) priority with detailed attributes: Color, Owner, Priority level, Origin, Component ID.

#### Average Color Sensor

Displays the average RGB color as a hex value with RGB array attributes. Data sources (in priority order):

1. LED gradient stream — real-time data from the LED Gradient camera when that entity is enabled and streaming (throttled to 2-second intervals).
2. Server-side `current-state` / `average-color` — HyperHDR JSON-RPC (requires `hyperhdr-py-sickkick` ≥ 0.2.3).
3. Visible priority COLOR component — falls back to the color of the currently visible priority.

### Number

Smoothing number entities are created when HyperHDR `config` getconfig returns a smoothing object (requires admin auth when enabled on the server):

| Entity | Range | Step | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|-------|
| Smoothing Time | 25–5000 ms | 25 | `time_ms` |
| Smoothing Update Frequency | 20–200 Hz | 5 | `updateFrequency` |
| Smoothing Factor | 0.0–1.0 | 0.05 | `smoothingFactor` |
| Smoothing Stiffness | 0–1000 | 10 | `stiffness` |
| Smoothing Damping | 0–1000 | 2 | `damping` |
| Smoothing Y Limit | 0.0–1.0 | 0.01 | `y_limit` |

All are disabled by default. The legacy Smoothing Decay entity is removed on load.

### Select

One select entity is conditionally created:

- **Smoothing Type** (disabled by default) — Options: `Stepper`, `YuvInterpolator`, `RgbInterpolator`, `HybridInterpolator`, `HybridRgbInterpolator`, `ExponentialInterpolator`.

---

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Instance Support

The integration supports multiple HyperHDR instances per server. Entities are created dynamically for each running instance and are automatically added or removed as instances start and stop. All entities for a given instance are grouped under a single device in Home Assistant.

### Automatic Entity Cleanup

When upgrading from older versions, the integration automatically removes stale entities from the Home Assistant entity registry:

- **Permanently removed:** The old JSON-API camera entity, Color Engine select, and Smoothing Decay number are always cleaned up.
- **Conditionally removed:** Smoothing config entities are removed for any instance whose smoothing config could not be loaded (for example when admin authentication is required but no Admin Password is configured).

No manual intervention is required — the cleanup runs on every integration load.

### Camera Troubleshooting

If the camera entities are not streaming:

1. **Enable the entity:** Both camera entities are disabled by default. Enable them in Home Assistant's entity settings first.
2. **Check HyperHDR is streaming:** Confirm your HyperHDR instance has an active video source (USB Capture, Video Grabber, etc.).
3. **Check the WebSocket port:** The default is `8090` — make sure it matches your HyperHDR configuration.
4. **Verify authentication:** Ensure the admin password is configured correctly (check integration **Options**).
5. **Enable debug logging** (see [Debug Logging](#debug-logging) below for camera-specific logging).

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.hyperhdr.camera: debug
    hyperhdr.stream: debug
```

Viewing options in Home Assistant: **Lovelace** — Add a camera card to your dashboard. **Developer Tools** — Use the Camera entity to view the current snapshot. **Mobile App** — View the live stream in the Home Assistant mobile application. **MJPEG Stream** — Access the raw stream at `/api/camera_proxy_stream/camera.<entity_id>`.

## Post-setup Advice

The best settings for an individual's HyperHDR setup are subjective and will vary greatly; my recommendations:

1. Go into the HyperHDR web UI → **Image Processing** → **Color Calibration**.
2. Un-check **Colored backlight**.
3. Un-check **Classic HyperHDR calibration**.
4. Click **Save settings**.

## Debug Logging

Add the following to the [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/logger/) section of your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.hyperhdr: debug
```

For more targeted debugging, you can enable logging for specific modules:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.hyperhdr: debug           # all integration logs
    custom_components.hyperhdr.camera: debug    # camera-specific logs
    custom_components.hyperhdr.light: debug    # light-specific logs
    hyperhdr.stream: debug                      # WebSocket stream library logs
```
